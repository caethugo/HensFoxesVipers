Multi-agents Hen Fox Viper simulation 

It's a pretty cool project we had with Julien Séailles AND Mattéo Boissier. The goal was to simulate some games of Hen Fox Viper and to try different strategies in this multi-agent simulation and observe their effects on group movements and behavioral patterns.
